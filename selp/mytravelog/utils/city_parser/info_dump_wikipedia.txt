S'Hong Kong (\xe9\xa6\x99\xe6\xb8\xaf; "Fragrant Harbour"), officially known as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\'s Republic of China, is a region on the southern coast of China geographically enclosed by the Pearl River Delta and South China Sea.[8] Hong Kong is known for its expansive skyline and deep natural harbour, and with a land mass of 1,104\xc2\xa0km2 (426\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi) and a population of over seven million people, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.[9] Hong Kong\'s population is 93.6% ethnic Chinese and 6.4% from other groups.[4] Hong Kong\'s Cantonese-speaking majority originate mainly from the neighbouring Guangdong province,[10] from which many of them fled to escape wars and communist rule in mainland China from the 1930s to 1960s.[11][12][13][14]Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the First Opium War (1839\xe2\x80\x9342). Hong Kong Island was first ceded in perpetuity to Great Britain, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and then the New Territories were put under lease in 1898. It was occupied by Japan during The Second World War (1941\xe2\x80\x9345), after which the British resumed control until 1997. The amalgam of British and Chinese culture during the colonial era shaped the current culture of Hong Kong. For example, the educational system followed the British model until 2009.'

It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85\xc2\xa0mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the lozenge-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets.[8] Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country's territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers."

The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in Central Thailand, and has a population of over 8 million, or 12.6 percent of the country's population. Over 14 million people (22.2 percent) live within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region, making Bangkok an extreme primate city, dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in terms of importance.Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century, which eventually grew in size and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of Siam's (as Thailand used to be known) modernization during the later 19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was the centre stage of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule and underwent numerous coups and uprisings. The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact among Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society."

Macau lies on the western side of the Pearl River Delta across from Hong Kong, which is about 64 kilometers to the east, and it is also bordered by Guangdong Province to the north and the South China Sea to the east and south.[9] With an estimated population of around 624,000 living in an area of 31.3 km2 (12.1 sq mi), it is the most densely populated region in the world.[10]A former Portuguese colony, Macau was administered by Portugal from the mid-16th century until late 1999, when it was the last remaining European colony in Asia.[11][12] Portuguese traders first settled in Macau in the 1550s. In 1557, Macau was rented to Portugal by the Ming Dynasty as a trading port. The Portuguese administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until 1887, when Macau became a colony of the Portuguese Empire. Sovereignty over Macau was transferred back to China on 20 December 1999. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of Macau stipulate that Macau operate with a high degree of autonomy until at least 2049, fifty years after the transfer.[13]"

S'Antalya (Turkish pronunciation:\xc2\xa0[an\xcb\x88talja]), is a city on the Mediterranean coast of southwestern Turkey. It is Turkey\'s biggest international sea resort, located on the Turkish Riviera.In 2013, Antalya became the third most visited city in the world by number of international arrivals, ranking behind Paris and London, respectively.[3] Antalya previously ranked third in the world in 2011[4] and 2012 and fourth in 2010[5] with over 10.5 million visitors in 2011.[6][7]The city was founded as "Attaleia" (Greek: \xce\x91\xcf\x84\xcf\x84\xce\xac\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xb1), named after its founder Attalos II, king of Pergamon.[8] This name, still in use in Greek, later mutated in Turkish as Adalia and then Antalya.[9] Attaleia was also the name of a festival at Delphi and Attalis (Greek: \xe1\xbc\x88\xcf\x84\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xaf\xcf\x82) was the name of an old Greek tribe at Athens.[10][11] Despite the close similarity, there is no relationship to the name Anatolia.It is uncertain when the site of the current city was first inhabited. Attalos II, king of Pergamon, is believed to have founded the city around 150 BC, during the Hellenistic period, naming it Attalia and selecting it as a naval base for his powerful fleet. However, excavations in 2008 in the Do\xc4\x9fu Garaj\xc4\xb1 district have uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that the city was founded earlier than previously supposed. Antalya became part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC when King Attalos III of Pergamon bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death. The city grew and prospered during the Ancient Roman period.'

With 2.9\xc2\xa0million residents in 1,285.3\xc2\xa0km2 (496.3\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi), it is also the country\'s largest and most populated comune and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.8 million.[2] Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in Rome metropolitan area.[3][4][5][6][7] The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. Vatican City is an independent country within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.[8][9]Rome\'s history spans more than two and a half thousand years, since its legendary founding in 753 BC. Rome is one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. It is referred to as "The Eternal City" (Latin: Roma Aeterna), a central notion in ancient Roman culture.[10] In the ancient world it was successively the capital city of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilization. Since the 1st century AD, Rome has been considered the seat of the Papacy and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.'

Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's legislature.[4] The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's northern coastline and heads up the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai recently won the bid for the World Expo 2020.[5]Today, Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Persian Gulf region.[6] It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo. By the 1960s Dubai's economy was based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but oil wasn't discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969.[7] Dubai's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirates' revenue comes from oil.[8] The emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[9][10][11] Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events. The city has become symbolic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city's largely South Asian workforce.[12] Dubai's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 following the financial crisis of 2007-2008,[13] but is making a gradual recovery with help from neighbouring emirates.[14]"

Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Phang Nga and Krabi, but as Phuket is an island it has no land boundaries.Phuket, which is somewhat smaller than the size of Singapore, is Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s largest island. The island is connected to mainland Thailand by two bridges. It is situated off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber, and enjoys a rich and colorful history. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ship logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch and English traders. The region now derives much of its income from tourism.The relatively recent name "Phuket" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p) is apparently derived from the word bukit (Jawi: \xd8\xa8\xd9\x88\xd9\x83\xd9\x8a\xd8\xaa) in Malay which means "hill", as this is what the island appears like from a distance. An alternative suggestion is that the name originates from two Thai words, "phu" (mountain) of "ket" (jewel), and this is said to be recorded in a Thai chronicle.Phuket was formerly known as Thalang (\xe0\xb8\x96\xe0\xb8\xa5\xe0\xb8\xb2\xe0\xb8\x87 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay "telong" (Jawi: \xd8\xaa\xd9\x84\xd9\x88\xda\xa0) which means "cape". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Jung Ceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., "Cape Salang"),[2]'

The city is located 70\xc2\xa0km (43\xc2\xa0mi) inland from Jeddah in a narrow valley at a height of 277\xc2\xa0m (909\xc2\xa0ft) above sea level. Its resident population in 2012 was roughly 2 million, although visitors more than triple this number every year during Hajj period held in the twelfth Muslim lunar month of Dhu al-Hijjah.As the birthplace of Muhammad and the site of Muhammad's first revelation of the Quran (specifically, a cave 3\xc2\xa0km (2\xc2\xa0mi) from Mecca),[5][6] Mecca is regarded as the holiest city in the religion of Islam[7] and a pilgrimage to it known as the Hajj is obligatory for all able Muslims. Mecca is home to the Kaaba, by majority description Islam's holiest site, as well as being the direction of Muslim prayer. Mecca was long ruled by Muhammad's descendants, the sharifs, acting either as independent rulers or as vassals to larger polities. It was absorbed into Saudi Arabia in 1925. In its modern period, Mecca has seen tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, home to structures such as the Abraj Al Bait, also known as the Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel, the world's third tallest building and the building with the largest amount of floor area. During this expansion, Mecca has lost some historical structures and archaeological sites, such as the Ajyad Fortress.[8] Today, more than 15 million Muslims visit Mecca annually, including several million during the few days of the Hajj.[9] As a result, Mecca has become one of the most cosmopolitan and diverse cities in the Muslim world,[10] despite the fact that non-Muslims are prohibited from entering the city.[11][12]"

Pattaya is the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area, the conurbation in Chonburi Province, with a total population exceeding 1,000,000.[citation needed]The name Pattaya evolved from the march of Phraya Tak (later King Taksin) and his army from Ayutthaya to Chanthaburi, which took place before the fall of the former capital to the Burmese invaders in 1767.When his army arrived at the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak\'s dignified manner and his army\'s strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as "Thap Phraya", which means the "army of the Phraya". This later became Pattaya, the name of the wind blowing from the southwest to the northeast at the beginning of the rainy season.'

S"Shanghai is the largest Chinese city by population[8][9] and the largest city proper by population in the world.[10] It is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China, with a population of more than 24 million as of 2013[update].[5] It is a global financial center,[11] and a transport hub with the world's busiest container port.[12] Located in the Yangtze River Delta in East China, Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.[13]For centuries a major administrative, shipping, and trading town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to European recognition of its favorable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five opened to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War while the subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between east and west, and became the undisputed financial hub of the Asia Pacific in the 1930s.[14] However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was reoriented to focus on socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city.[15]"

It is the country's principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, and transportation centre,[10] sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary.[11] In 2011, according to the census, Budapest had 1.74 million inhabitants,[12] down from its 1989 peak of 2.1 million[13] due to suburbanisation.[14] The Budapest Metropolitan Area is home to 3.3 million people.[15][16] The city covers an area of 525 square kilometres (202.7\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi)[17] within the city limits.

S'Vienna (/vi\xcb\x90\xcb\x88\xc9\x9bn\xc9\x99/; German: \xc2\xa0Wien\xc2\xa0(help\xc2\xb7info) [vi\xcb\x90n], Austro-Bavarian: Wean) is the capital and largest city of Austria, and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria\'s primary city, with a population of about 1.757\xc2\xa0million[5] (2.4\xc2\xa0million within the metropolitan area,[4] more than 20% of Austria\'s population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I the city had 2 million inhabitants.[6] Today it is the second only to Berlin in German speakers.[7][8] Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city lies in the east of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3\xc2\xa0million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[9]Apart from being regarded as the City of Music[10] because of its musical legacy, Vienna is also said to be "The City of Dreams" because it was home to the world\'s first psycho-analyst \xe2\x80\x93 Sigmund Freud.[11] The city\'s roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading European music centre, from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstrasse lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.[12]'

Its status as the Dutch capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands[7] though it is not the seat of the Dutch government, which is The Hague.[8] Amsterdam has a population of 813,562 within the city-proper, 1,112,165 in the urban region and 1,575,263 in the greater metropolitan area.[9] The city itself, contrary to the Dutch national institute of statistics, calculates the number of inhabitants in the greater metropolitan area to be 2,332,773.[10] The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. It comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7\xc2\xa0million.[11]Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme,[12] indicative of the city's origin as a dam of the river Amstel. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the Dutch Golden Age (17th century), a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading center for finance and diamonds.[13] In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19\xe2\x80\x9320th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List."

With a population of 3.6 million people,[4] Berlin is Germany's largest city. It is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union.[5] Located in northeastern Germany on the River Spree, it is the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 4.5 million residents from over 184 nations.[6][7][8][9] Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.[10]First documented in the 13th century, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701\xe2\x80\x931918), the German Empire (1871\xe2\x80\x931918), the Weimar Republic (1919\xe2\x80\x931933) and the Third Reich (1933\xe2\x80\x931945).[11] Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world.[12] After World War II, the city was divided; East Berlin became the capital of East Germany while West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961\xe2\x80\x931989).[13] Following German reunification in 1990, the city was once more designated as the capital of all Germany, hosting 158 foreign embassies.[14]"

Tokyo is in the Kant\xc5\x8d region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.[8] Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (\xe6\x9d\xb1\xe4\xba\xac\xe5\xba\x9c, T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d-fu?) and the city of Tokyo (\xe6\x9d\xb1\xe4\xba\xac\xe5\xb8\x82, T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d-shi?).Tokyo is often referred to and thought of as a city, but is officially known and governed as a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of both a city and a prefecture; a characteristic unique to Tokyo. The Tokyo metropolitan government administers the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo (each governed as an individual city), which cover the area that was formerly the City of Tokyo before it merged and became the subsequent metropolitan prefecture in 1943. The metropolitan government also administers 39 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture and the two outlying island chains. The population of the special wards is over 9 million people, with the total population of the prefecture exceeding 13 million. The prefecture is part of the world\'s most populous metropolitan area with upwards of 37.8 million people and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy. The city hosts 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies, the highest number of any city.[9] The city is also home of various television networks like Fuji TV and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.'

S'Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa [var\xcb\x88\xca\x82ava]\xc2\xa0( listen); see also other names), is the capital and largest city of Poland. It is located on the Vistula River, in east-central Poland, roughly 260 kilometres (160\xc2\xa0mi) from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres (190\xc2\xa0mi) from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.711 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most populous capital city in the European Union.[2][3][4] The area of the city covers 516.9 square kilometres (199.6\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi), while the city\'s agglomeration covers 6,100.43 square kilometres (2,355.39\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi).[5]The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, when initially Krak\xc3\xb3w served as the Polish capital city. Due to its central location between the Commonwealth\'s capitals of Krak\xc3\xb3w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\xc3\xb3w to Warsaw in 1596.[6] After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire created by Napoleon Bonaparte. With accordance to the decision of the Congress of Vienna, Warsaw in 1815 was annexed by the Russian Empire and became part of the "Congress Kingdom". Only in 1918 it regained independence from the foreign rule and emerged as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. Along with the German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to a major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. For this Warsaw gained the title of the "phoenix city" because it has survived so many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city had to be painstakingly rebuilt after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, during which 85% of its buildings were destroyed.[7][8] On 9 November 1940 the city was awarded Poland\'s highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).[9][10]'

Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest industrial and commercial centre in South India,[6] and a major cultural, economic and educational centre. Chennai is known as the "Detroit of India" for its automobile industry.[7] As a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, Chennai confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems.The area of Chennai (Chennai Corporation) was expanded in September 2011 from 176 Sq Km to 426 Sq Km, with a subsequent redefinition bump from 4.6 million to 8.7 million people inside the new city limits during the March 2011 census. The urban agglomeration may now be considered the city itself (though suburbs do exist beyond the new expanded limits, the metropolitan definition has yet to be updated), currently ranked as fourth most populous metropolitan area in the country and 31st largest urban area in the world.The city is host to the third largest expatriate population in India after Mumbai and Delhi, with 35,000 in 2009 and steadily climbing to 82,790 in 2011.[8][9] Chennai is the only city in South Asia and India to figure in the "52 places to go around the world" by The New York Times.[10][11][12] Leading tourism guide publisher Lonely Planet has named Chennai as one of the top ten cities in the world to visit in 2015.[13] Chennai is ranked as a beta level city in the Global Cities Index only behind Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore, and ahead of Kolkata, Hyderabad and Colombo.'

Its metropolitan area is the 16th largest in the world. Located near the Nile Delta,[1][2] it was founded in AD 969. Nicknamed "the city of a thousand minarets" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture, Cairo has long been a center of the region\'s political and cultural life. Cairo was founded by Jawhar al-Siqilli "The Sicilian",among the Fatimid dynasty in the 10th century CE, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. Cairo is also associated with Ancient Egypt as it is close to the ancient cities of Memphis, Giza and Fustat which are near the Great Sphinx and the pyramids of Giza.Egyptians today often refer to Cairo as Ma\xe1\xb9\xa3r ([m\xc9\x91s\xcb\xa4\xc9\xbe], \xd9\x85\xd8\xb5\xd8\xb1), the Egyptian Arabic pronunciation of the name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city\'s continued role in Egyptian influence.[3][4] Its official name is \xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd9\x82\xd8\xa7\xd9\x87\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa9 al-Q\xc4\x81hirah\xe2\x80\xaf, means literally: "The defeater", in reference to the fact that the planet was rising at the time when the city was founded[5] as well as, "the Vanquisher"; "the Conqueror"; Egyptian Arabic pronunciation:\xc2\xa0[elq\xc9\x91(\xcb\x90)\xcb\x88he\xc9\xbe\xc9\x91], "the defeater" or, " "the victorious" (al-Qahira) in reference to the much awaited[6] Caliph al-Mu\'izz li Din Allah who arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in 973 to the city. The Egyptian name for Cairo is said to be: Khere-Ohe, meaning: "The Place of Combat", supposedly, in reference to a battle which took place between the Gods Seth and Horus.[7] Sometimes the city is informally also referred to as \xd9\x83\xd8\xa7\xd9\x8a\xd8\xb1\xd9\x88 Kayro [\xcb\x88k\xc3\xa6j\xc9\xbeo].[8] It is also called Umm al-Dunya, meaning "the mother of the world".[9]'

S'Nairobi /na\xc9\xaa\xcb\x88ro\xca\x8abi/ is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County. The name "Nairobi" comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to "cool water". The phrase is also the Maasai name of the Nairobi river, which in turn lent its name to the city. However, it is popularly known as the "Green City in the Sun" and is surrounded by several expanding villa suburbs.[2] Inhabitants of Nairobi are called Nairobians, and the city is governed by the County Government of Nairobi, whose current governor is Evans Kidero.Nairobi was founded by the British in 1899 as a simple rail depot on the railway linking Mombasa to Uganda.[3] The town quickly grew to become the capital of British East Africa in 1907, and eventually the capital of the newly independent Kenya Republic in 1963.[4] During Kenya\'s colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony\'s coffee, tea and sisal industry.[5] Nairobi is also a county in itself. The city lies on the Nairobi River in the southern part of country, and has an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889\xc2\xa0ft) above sea level.[6]With a 2011 estimated population of about 3.36 million, Nairobi is the second-largest city by population in the African Great Lakes region after Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.[1][7] According to the 2009 census, in the administrative area of Nairobi, 3,138,295 inhabitants lived within 696\xc2\xa0km2 (269\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi).[8] Nairobi is the 14th-largest city in Africa, including the population of its suburbs.'

S"\xc2\xa0Hangzhou\xc2\xa0(help\xc2\xb7info), formerly romanised as Hangchow, is the capital and largest city of Zhejiang Province in Eastern China.[4] It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay on China's coast between Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium, due in part to its beautiful natural scenery. The city's West Lake is its best-known attraction.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city[5] and forms the core of the Hangzhou Metropolitan Area,[2] the fourth-largest metropolitan area in China.[6] During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585\xc2\xa0km2 (13,353\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi).[2] Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 8.7 million[7] and the built-up area (including the Keqiao and Yuecheng districts of Shaoxing) held 8,156,600. The municipality had a population of 6.242 million, of whom 3.56 million lived in the six urban districts.The celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100\xc2\xa0km (62\xc2\xa0mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago.[8] It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeastern China.[9] Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago.[10]"

The city proper has a population of about 1.3 million, while its urban area is the 5th largest in the EU with an estimated population of about 5,264,000.[3] The massive suburban sprawl that followed the post-war boom of the 1950s\xe2\x80\x9360s and the growth of a vast commuter belt, suggest that socioeconomic linkages have expanded well beyond the boundaries of its administrative limits and its agglomeration, creating a polycentric metropolitan area of 7[4][6][7]-10[8] million people, stretching over the former provinces of Milan, Bergamo, Como, Lecco, Lodi, Monza and Brianza, Pavia, Varese, Novara. It has been suggested that the Milan metropolitan region is part of the so-called Blue Banana, the area of Europe with the highest population and industrial density.[9]Milan was founded by the Insubres, a Celtic people. The city was later conquered by the Romans, eventually becoming the capital of the Western Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, Milan flourished as a commercial and banking center.[10] In the course of centuries, it has been alternatively dominated by France, Habsburg Spain, and Austria, until 1859 when the city joined the rising Kingdom of Italy. During the early 1900s, Milan led the industrialization process of the young nation, being at the very center of the economic, social, and political debate. Badly affected by World War II, and after a harsh Nazi occupation, the city became the main centre of the Italian Resistance.[11] In post-war years, the city enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, attracting large flows of workers from Southern Italy.[12] During the last decades, Milan has seen a dramatic rise in the number of international immigrants, and in 2011 more than one sixth of its population is foreign born.[13]'

It is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in the state of California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City.[24] San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose, and the 14th-most populous city in the United States\xe2\x80\x94with a Census-estimated 2013 population of 837,442.[19] The city and its surroundings are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, part of the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, with a population of 8.5 million.San Francisco (Spanish for "Saint Francis") was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established a fort at the Golden Gate and a mission named for St. Francis of Assisi a few miles away.[25] The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. Due to the growth of its population, San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.[26] After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire,[27] San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. During World War II, San Francisco was the port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater.[28] After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the "hippie" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States.'

The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the third-largest conurbation in Latin America, with a population of around fifteen and a half million.[2]The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district.[6] In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalised and removed from Buenos Aires Province.[7] The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Aut\xc3\xb3noma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a Chief of Government (i.e. Mayor) in 1996; before, the Mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.Buenos Aires is, along with Mexico City and S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, one of the three Latin American cities considered an 'alpha city' by the study GaWC5.[8] Buenos Aires, Argentina has the third best quality of life of Latin American cities.[9] Buenos Aires' quality of life is ranked 81st in the world, with its per capita income among the three highest in the region.[9][10][11] It is the most visited city in South America (ahead of Rio de Janeiro) and the second most visited city across Spanish Latin America (behind Mexico City).[12] It is also one of the most important, largest and most populous of South American capitals, often referred to as the Paris of South America.[13]"

The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire before the Act of Union in 1800. Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State and later the Republic of Ireland.Dublin is administered by a City Council. The city is listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha-", placing it among the top thirty cities in the world.[8][9] It is a historical and contemporary centre for education, the arts, administration, economy and industry.Although the area of Dublin Bay has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, the writings of Ptolemy (the Greco-Roman astronomer and cartographer) in about 140 AD provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called the settlement Eblana polis (Greek: \xe1\xbc\x9c\xce\xb2\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xce\xb1 \xcf\x80\xcf\x8c\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xcf\x82).[10]The name Dublin comes from the Irish name Dubhlinn or Duibhlinn, meaning "black pool". This is made up of the elements dubh (black) and linn (pool). In most Irish dialects, dubh is pronounced [\xcb\x88d\xcc\xaa\xcb\xa0\xca\x8av\xcb\xa0]. The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as Old English Difelin, Old Norse Dyflin, modern Icelandic Dyflinn and modern Manx Divlyn. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name Duibhlinn, variously anglicized as Devlin,[11] Divlin[12] and Difflin.[13] Historically, scribes using the Gaelic script wrote bh with a dot over the b, rendering Du\xe1\xb8\x83linn or Dui\xe1\xb8\x83linn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as Dublin.'

It is the center of the district the same name, as well as of Mu\xc4\x9fla Province, which stretches along Turkey\xc2\xb4s Aegean coast. Mu\xc4\x9fla center is situated inland at an altitude of 660\xc2\xa0m and lies at a distance of about 30\xc2\xa0km (19\xc2\xa0mi) from the nearest seacoast in the Gulf of G\xc3\xb6kova to its south-west.

Mu\xc4\x9fla is the administrative capital of a province that incorporates internationally well-known and popular tourist resorts such as Bodrum, Marmaris and Fethiye and also the smaller resort of SarigermeThe district area's physical features are determined by several pot-shaped high plains abbreviated by mountains, of which the largest is the one where the city of Mu\xc4\x9fla is located and which is called under the same name (Mu\xc4\x9fla Plain). It is surrounded by slopes denuded of soil, paved with calcerous formations and a scrub cover which gives the immediate vicinity of Mu\xc4\x9fla a barren look uncharacteristic for its region. Arable land is restricted to valley bottoms.A relatively small city of 61,550 (2009 estimates) and often overlooked by visitors to nearby coastal resorts, Mu\xc4\x9fla has received a new boost with the foundation of Mu\xc4\x9fla University in the 1990s. Today, the university brings together a student community of 16,000 and, added by its academia and staff, it played a key role in bringing movement to the city and in opening it to the outside world. Its former profile of a predominantly rural, difficult to access, isolated and underpopulated region enclosed with a rugged mountainous complex is now coming to an end. Also in recent years, a major program of restoration of the city's architectural heritage has enhanced local tourism. The city remains an orderly, compact and leafy provincial center which could keep its old neighborhoods without surrendering to a boom in concrete constructions and displays a progressist mind as exemplified by the pride still expressed on having had Turkey's first female provincial governor in the 1990s, Ms. Lale Aytaman. Nevertheless, Mu\xc4\x9fla still lacks sizeable manufacturing and processing centers and relies on trades, crafts, services, tourism and agriculture in its economy."

In 2009, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[10] It is also the wealthiest city in India,[11] and has the highest GDP of any city in South, West or Central Asia.[citation needed]The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies.[12] For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[13][13] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[14] Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterized by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996.[15]"

Situated on the island of Bali, it is known worldwide as a major tourist destination, and is the main gateway to Bali. The city is also a hub for other cities in the Lesser Sunda Islands.With the rapid growth of the tourism industry in Bali, Denpasar has encouraged and promoted business activities and ventures, contributing to it having the highest growth rate in Bali Province. The population of Denpasar was 834,881 in 2012,[1] up from 788,445 at the 2010 Census. The surrounding metropolitan area has roughly 2 million residents. The municipality\'s area extent, population, and density are similar to San Francisco.The name Denpasar - from the Balinese words "den", meaning north, and "pasar", meaning market - indicates the city\'s origins as a market-town, on the site of what is now Kumbasari Market (formerly "Peken Payuk"), in the northern part of the modern city.[2]Denpasar was the capital of the Kingdom of Badung. The royal palace was looted and razed during the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906). A statue in Taman Puputan (Denpasar\'s central square) commemorates the 1906 Puputan, in which as many as a thousand Balinese, including the Raja and his court, committed mass suicide in front of invading Dutch troops, rather than submit to them.[3]'

S"Toronto (/t\xc9\xb5\xcb\x88r\xc9\x92nto\xca\x8a/, local /\xcb\x88tr\xc9\x92no\xca\x8a/) is the most populous city in Canada and the provincial capital of Ontario. It is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The history of Toronto began in the late 18th century when the British Crown purchased its land from the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The settlement established there became York, which lieutenant governor John Graves Simcoe designated as the capital of Upper Canada. The city was ransacked in the Battle of York during the War of 1812. In 1834, York became a city and renamed to Toronto. It was damaged in two huge fires in 1849 and 1904. Since 1954, the city occasionally expanded its borders through amalgamation with surrounding municipalities, most recently occurring in 1998.According to the 2011 Census, the city has 2.6\xc2\xa0million residents, making it the fifth-most populous city in North America. However, in 2012, the municipal government published a population estimate of 2,791,140, which led to media reports claiming Toronto as the fourth most populous city in North America and the most populous Great Lakes city, surpassing Chicago.[3][4] The census metropolitan area (CMA) had a population of 5,583,064,[5] and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) had a population of 6,054,191 in the 2011 Census.[6] Toronto is at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area, and of the densely populated region in Southern Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. Its cosmopolitan and international population[7] reflects its role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada.[8] Toronto is one of the world's most diverse cities by percentage of non-native-born residents, with about 49% of the population born outside Canada.[7][8][9]"

S"Zhuhai (Chinese: \xe7\x8f\xa0\xe6\xb5\xb7; pinyin: Zh\xc5\xabh\xc7\x8ei) is a prefecture-level city on the southern coast of Guangdong province in China. Located in the Pearl River Delta, Zhuhai borders Jiangmen to the northwest, Zhongshan to the north, and Macau to the south. Zhuhai was one of the original Special Economic Zones established in the 1980s. Zhuhai is also one of China's premier tourist destinations, being called the Chinese Riviera. The city's population is made up of mostly Mandarin speaking migrants.According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhuhai is the most livable city in China.[1]The prefecture-level city of Zhuhai administers 3 county-level divisions and 3 special economic districts, all of which are districts.Zhuhai borders the Macau Special Administrative Region (north and west), and 140 kilometres (87 miles) southwest of Guangzhou. Its territory includes 146 islands and a coastline of 690 kilometres (429 miles).The islands within the prefecture-level city of Zhuhai include a number of near-shore islands, often connected to the mainland by bridges or causeways (such as Hengqin, Qi'ao, or Yeli Islands), as well as some islands in the open South China Sea (the Wanshan Archipelago). Some of the latter are actually geographically closer to Hong Kong than to the Zhuhai mainland. The jurisdiction of Nei Lingding Island, located in the Pearl River estuary was transferred from Zhuhai to Shenzhen in 2009.[2]"

The LUKOIL Neftochim Burgas is the largest oil refinery in south-eastern Europe and the largest industrial enterprise. The Port of Burgas is the largest port in Bulgaria, and Burgas Airport is the second-most important in the country. Burgas is the centre of the Bulgarian fishing and fish processing industry.[2]There are several possible origins for the name of the city, which is similar to Burgos, a city in Spain. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country got into the fortified village, named "Pyrgos" (\xce\xa0\xcf\x8d\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82) which is Greek for "tower" or "fortress"[3] ("burgos" being its Latin equivalent, see: Burgus).[4] By another theory, the city\'s name comes from Latin, or a Gothic name meaning signified consolidated walled villages (Gothic "baurgs").[5]Burgas is situated in the westernmost point of the bay of the same name and in the eastern part of the Burgas Plain, in the east of the Upper Thracian Plain. Burgas is located 389 kilometres (242\xc2\xa0mi) from Sofia, 272\xc2\xa0km (169\xc2\xa0mi) from Plovdiv, and 335\xc2\xa0km (208\xc2\xa0mi) from Istanbul. To the west, south and north, the city is surrounded by the Burgas Lakes: Burgas, Atanasovsko and Mandrensko, which are home to several hundred bird species.

Since convict transportation ended in the mid 1800s the city has become a global cultural and economic centre.[14][15][16][17] The population of Sydney at the time of the 2011 census was 4.39 million.[18] About 1.5 million of this total were born overseas and represent a multitude of different countries from around the world.[3] There are more than 250 different languages spoken in Sydney and about one-third of residents speak a language other than English at home.[19][20]Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing, and tourism. Its gross regional product was $337.45 billion in 2013 making it a larger economy than countries such as Denmark, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[21] There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as Asia Pacific\'s leading financial hub.[22][23][24][25] In addition to hosting events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics, millions of tourists come to Sydney each year to see the city\'s landmarks.[26] Its natural features include Sydney Harbour, the Royal National Park, Bondi Beach, and the Royal Botanic Gardens.

It had a population of 139,544 at the 2004 Census, while the latest official estimate (as at 1 July 2013) is 158,941.Djerba has a mild climate and fertile soil. Its largest city is Houmt-Souk, with a population of around 65,000. Known for its beautiful beaches and dramatic sunsets, the island is a popular tourist destination, particularly with French, German and Italian tourists. It is one of the few remaining places in Tunisia where a Berber language is still spoken. Another factor drawing some tourists to Djerba is that, in 1977, the town of Ajim was used as the setting for the Mos Eisley exterior scenes in the first Star Wars movie.Djerba is noted as a center of the Islamic sect Al-Ibadhiyah and for its Jewish minority, which has dwelt on the island for more than 2,500 years, although the Jewish population has declined significantly since 1967 due to emigration to Israel and France. With a large percentage of the community being direct Patrilineal descendants of Aaron the first high priest, the island was once known as the island of the Kohanim, Hebrew for the Jewish Priestly caste. The El Ghriba synagogue on Djerba is over 2,000 years old, making it one of the oldest and most famous synagogues in the world.[2][3]'

Munich is the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, with a population of around 1.49\xc2\xa0million.[3] The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 5.6 million people.[4]The name of the city is derived from the Old High German term Munichen, meaning "by the monks". It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city\'s coat of arms. Munich was first mentioned in 1158. From 1255 the city was seat of the Bavarian Dukes. Black and gold \xe2\x80\x94 the colours of the Holy Roman Empire \xe2\x80\x94 have been the city\'s official colours since the time of Ludwig the Bavarian, when it was an imperial residence. Following a final reunification of the Wittelsbachian Duchy of Bavaria, previously divided and sub-divided for more than 200 years, the town became the country\'s sole capital in 1506. Catholic Munich was a cultural stronghold of the Counter-Reformation and a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years\' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes; as the townsfolk would rather open the gates of their town than risk siege and almost inevitable destruction[citation needed]. Like wide parts of the Holy Roman Empire, the area recovered slowly economically. Having evolved from a duchy\'s capital into that of an electorate (1623), and later a sovereign kingdom (1806), Munich has been a centre of arts, culture and science since the early 19th century. The city became the Nazi movement\'s infamous Hauptstadt der Bewegung (lit.: "Capital of the movement"), and after post-war reconstruction was the host city of the 1972 Summer Olympics.'

Johannesburg is the provincial capital of Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa, having the largest economy of any metropolitan region in Sub-Saharan Africa.[7] The city is one of the 50 largest urban agglomerations in the world,[8] and is also the world's largest city not situated on a river, lake, or coastline.[9]While Johannesburg is not one of South Africa's three capital cities, it is the seat of the Constitutional Court, which has the final word on interpretation of South Africa's constitution, and is the provincial capital of Gauteng. The city is the source of a large-scale gold and diamond trade, due to its location on the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills.According to the 2007 Community Survey, the population of the city of Johannesburg was 4,434,827 and the population of the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area was 7,151,447.[10] A broader definition of the Johannesburg metropolitan area, including Ekurhuleni, the West Rand, Soweto and Lenasia, has a population of 10,267,700.[11] The municipal city's land area of 1,645\xc2\xa0km2 (635\xc2\xa0sq\xc2\xa0mi) is very large when compared with that of other cities, resulting in a moderate population density of 2,364/km2 (6,120/sq\xc2\xa0mi)."

S'Edirne (Turkish pronunciation:\xc2\xa0[e\xcb\x88di\xc9\xbene]), is a city in the Turkish region of East Thrace, close to its borders with Greece and Bulgaria. Edirne served as the third capital city of the Ottoman Empire from 1365 to 1453, before Constantinople (Istanbul) became the empire\'s fourth and final capital. At present, Edirne is the capital of the Edirne Province in Turkish Thrace. The city\'s estimated population in 2010 was 138,793, up from 119,298 in 2000. It has consulates of Bulgaria, Germany (Honorary), Greece, Romania (Honorary) and Slovakia (Honorary). Its sister cities are Haskovo and Yambol in Bulgaria and Alexandroupolis in Greece.The city was founded as Hadrianopolis (A\xce\xb4\xcf\x81\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xcf\x8d\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 in Greek), named for the Roman Emperor Hadrian.

S"Suzhou, formerly romanized as Soochow, is a major city in the southeast of Jiangsu Province in Eastern China, adjacent to Shanghai Municipality. It is the economical, trading and logistics center of Jiangsu, and the second largest city in the province after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with an urban population of over 5.4 million in its core districts. Suzhou is the ninth most populous city in mainland China, and the total population exceeded 10 million in its administrative area in 2010.[4] It is considered one of the richest major cities in China.[5]Originally founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of rich history, and relics of the past are abundant to this day. Circa AD 100, during the Eastern Han Dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from North China.[6][7] Since the 10th-century Song Dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing Dynasty, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural and commercial[8] center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion.[9] When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation.[10] Since the economic reforms started in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with growth rates of about 14% in past 35 years.[2][11] As of 2013[update], the Human Development Index (HDI) of Suzhou is 0.873 according to official data,[3] which is roughly equivalent to that of the Italy's."

Its architecture is a mix of historical (neo-classical), interbellum (Bauhaus and Art Deco), Communist-era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city\'s elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of "Little Paris" (Micul Paris).[6] Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and above all Nicolae Ceau\xc5\x9fescu\'s program of systematization, many survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom.[7]According to 2011 census, 1,883,425 inhabitants live within the city limits,[4] a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.[2] The urban area extends beyond the limits of Bucharest proper and has a population of about 1.9\xc2\xa0million people.[8] Adding the satellite towns around the urban area, the proposed metropolitan area of Bucharest would have a population of 2.27\xc2\xa0million people.[9] According to Eurostat, Bucharest has a Larger Urban Zone of 2,151,880 residents.[5] According to unofficial data, the population is more than 3 million.[10] Bucharest is the 6th largest city in the European Union by population within city limits, after London, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, and Paris.'

The area is best known for its beaches and balnearios, which face both the Caribbean and Atlantic, and it has been a popular tourist destination since the 1970s. The name Punta Cana refers to the cane palms in the region, and literally means "Tip of the White Cane Palms".[3]The Punta Cana area has an estimated population of 100,000, with a growth rate of six percent.[4] To the north, it borders the village and beach of Cabeza de Toro, and then the B\xc3\xa1varo and El Cortecito beaches. The nearest city, the 500-year-old capital of the Province Hig\xc3\xbcey, is 45 kilometres (28\xc2\xa0mi) away, and it takes about an hour to drive there. Europeans, particularly Spanish hotel chains, own all but two of the 50+ megaresorts of the Punta Cana tourism destination.The province\'s 100-kilometre (62\xc2\xa0mi) coastline tends to be mildly windy. The ocean waters are mainly shallows, with several natural marine pools in which visitors can bathe without any danger. From north to south, the main beaches are Uvero Alto, Macao, Arena Gorda, B\xc3\xa1varo, El Cortecito, Las Corales and Cabeza de Toro, all north of the cape; and Cabo Enga\xc3\xb1o, Punta Cana and Juanillo south of the cape.'

S'Agra (i/\xcb\x88\xc9\x91\xcb\x90\xc9\xa1r\xc9\x99/; \xc4\x80gr\xc4\x81), is a city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is 363 kilometres (226\xc2\xa0mi) west of the state capital, Lucknow, 200 kilometres (124\xc2\xa0mi) south of the national capital New Delhi and 125 kilometres (78\xc2\xa0mi) north of Gwalior . With a population of 1,686,976 (2010 est.), it is one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh and the 19th most populous in India.[2] Agra can also refer to the administrative district that has its headquarters in Agra city. It is a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings, most notably the T\xc4\x81j Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehp\xc5\xabr Sikr\xc4\xab, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur.The city was first mentioned in the epic Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, where it was called Agreva\xe1\xb9\x87a (derived from Sanskrit (\xe0\xa4\x85\xe0\xa4\x97\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa5\x87\xe0\xa4\xb5\xe0\xa4\xa3) meaning "the border of the forest").[3] Legend ascribes the founding of the city to Raja Badal Singh, a Sikarwar Rajput king (c. 1475), whose fort, Badalgarh, stood on or near the site of the present fort. However, the 11th century Persian poet Mas\'\xc5\xabd Sa\'d Salm\xc4\x81n writes of a desperate assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by the Sh\xc4\x81h\xc4\xab King Jayapala, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni.[4] It was mentioned for the first time in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. Sultan Sikandar Lod\xc4\xab(1488\xe2\x80\x931517) was the first to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1506. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibr\xc4\x81h\xc4\xabm Lod\xc4\xab, remained in power there for nine more years and several palaces, wells and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. Finally being defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526.[5] Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri ruled the area. It achieved fame as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1658.'

Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory.[3] Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For years it was a dominion of Savoy, then became part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to Piedmont-Sardinia until its reannexation by France in 1860."

Its population is approximately 35,000 as of 2008. Sharm el-Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt\'s South Sinai Governorate, which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, Saint Catherine\'s Monastery and Mount Sinai. Nowadays it is a major touristic hotspot and resort city in Egypt.Sharm el-Sheikh ("Bay of the Sheikh" in Arabic) is sometimes called the "City of Peace", referring to the large number of international peace conferences that have been held there. It was known as \xc5\x9earm-\xc3\xbc\xc5\x9f \xc5\x9eeyh during Ottoman rule and was known as Ofira during Israeli occupation between 1967 and 1982.

Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was captured by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and restored to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was subsequently stationed there until the 1967 Six-Day War when it was recaptured by Israel.

The current governor of the region is Prince Saud Bin Naif.The Eastern Province is home to most of Saudi Arabia's oil production. The region is also home of the City of Jubail, which hosts the Jubail Industrial City, a global hub for chemical industries. It is also a tourist area because of its location on the coast of the Persian Gulf and the variety of entertainment activities available across the region. Most of the tourists who visit the region are from the nearby states of the GCC, and the Riyadh Region.The Eastern Province borders the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.The primary airport in the region is King Fahd International Airport, the largest airport in the world in terms of land area. The King Fahd Causeway, completed in 1986, links the Eastern Province to neighboring island country of Bahrain.The largely uninhabited Rub' al Khali (Empty Quarter) desert occupies more than half of the province.The Saudis of Najd gained control of the area after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

It is the fourth largest city in the country after Casablanca, Rabat and Fes, and is the capital of the mid-southwestern region of Marrakesh-Tensift-El Haouz. Located to the north of the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains, by road Marrakesh is located 580\xc2\xa0km (360\xc2\xa0mi) southwest of Tangier, 327\xc2\xa0km (203\xc2\xa0mi) southwest of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, 239\xc2\xa0km (149\xc2\xa0mi) south of Casablanca, and 246\xc2\xa0km (153\xc2\xa0mi) northeast of Agadir.Marrakesh is possibly the most important of Morocco\'s four former imperial cities (cities that were built by Moroccan Berber empires). The region was inhabited by Berber farmers from Neolithic times, but the actual city was founded in 1062 AD by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and cousin of Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin. In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many madrasas (Koranic schools) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear Andalusian influences. The red walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122-1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period, have given the city the nickname of the "Red City" or "Ochre City". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa; Jemaa el-Fnaa is the busiest square in Africa.'

Long an important trading center in the Persian Gulf, Manama is home to a very diverse population. After periods of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions from the ruling dynasties of Saudi Arabia and Oman, Bahrain established itself as an independent nation during the 19th century period of British hegemony.Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been founded simultaneously in the 1800s,[1] Muharraq took prominence due to its defensive location and was thus the capital of Bahrain until 1921. Manama became the mercantile capital and was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island. [2] In the 20th century, Bahrain\'s oil wealth helped spur fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an important financial hub in the Middle East. Manama was designated as the capital of Arab culture for the year 2012 by the Arab League.[3][4]The name is derived from the Arabic word \xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd9\x85\xd9\x86\xd8\xa7\xd9\x85\xd8\xa9 (transliterated:al-man\xc3\xa3ma) meaning "the place of rest" or "the place of dreams".[5]There is evidence of human settlement on the northern coastline of Bahrain dating back to the Bronze Age. The Dilmun civilisation inhabited the area in 3000\xc2\xa0BC, serving as a key regional trading hub between Mesopotamia, Magan and the Indus Valley civilisation.[6][7] Approximately 100,000 Dilmun burial mounds were found across the north and central regions of the country, some originating 5,000 years ago. Despite the discovery of the mounds, there is no significant evidence to suggest heavy urbanisation took place during the Dilmun era. [8] It is believed that the majority of the population lived in rural areas, numbering several thousands. Evidence of an ancient large rural population was confirmed by one of Alexander the Great\'s ship captains, during voyages in the Persian Gulf. A vast system of aqueducts in northern Bahrain helped facilitate ancient horticulture and agriculture. [9]'

S'Hanoi (/h\xc3\xa6\xcb\x88n\xc9\x94\xcb\x90\xc9\xaa/ \xc2\xa0listen) is the capital of Vietnam and the country\'s second largest city. Its population in 2009 was estimated at 2.6 million for urban districts,[1] 6.5 million for the metropolitan jurisdiction.[2] From 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam. It was eclipsed by Hu\xe1\xba\xbf, the imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n Dynasty (1802\xe2\x80\x931945), but Hanoi served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902 to 1954. From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of North Vietnam, and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North\'s victory in the Vietnam War.The city lies on the right bank of the Red River. Hanoi is 1,760\xc2\xa0km (1,090\xc2\xa0mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City and 120\xc2\xa0km (75\xc2\xa0mi) west of Hai Phong city.October 2010 officially marked 1000 years since the establishment of the city.[3] The Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural is a 4\xc2\xa0km ceramic mosaic mural created to mark the occasion.Hanoi (\xe6\xb2\xb3\xe5\x85\xa7) has had many names throughout history, all of them of Sino-Vietnamese origin.

The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.Honolulu is both the westernmost and the southernmost major American city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as "City of Honolulu" (not to be confused with the "City and County") as a census county division (CCD).[8] Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of Honolulu CCD was 390,738 at the 2010 census,[9] while the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.Honolulu means "sheltered harbor"[10] or "calm port."[11] The old name is said to be Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nuuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district.[12] The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan near the city on December 7, 1941.'

S'Guilin is a prefecture-level city in the northeast of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, situated on the west bank of the Li River, and bordering Hunan to the north. Its name means, "Forest of Sweet Osmanthus", owing to the large number of fragrant Sweet Osmanthus trees located in the city. The city has long been renowned for its scenery of karst topography and is one of China\'s most popular tourist destinations.[1]During the Qin Dynasty\'s (221\xe2\x80\x93207 BC) campaigns against the state of Nanyue, the first administration was set up in the area around Guilin.[2]In 111 BC, during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Shi An County was established, which could be regarded as the beginning of the city.Guilin prospered in the Tang and Song dynasties but remained a county. The city was also a nexus between the central government and the southwest border, and it was where regular armies were placed to guard that border. Canals were built through the city so that food supplies could be directly transported from the food-productive Yangtze plain to the farthest southwestern point of the empire.In 1921, Guilin became one of the headquarters of the Northern Expeditionary Army led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.'

Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world.[4] In M\xc4\x81ori, Auckland's name is T\xc4\x81maki Makaurau and the transliterated version of Auckland is \xc4\x80karana.The Auckland urban area (as defined by Statistics New Zealand) ranges to Waiwera in the north, Kumeu in the northwest, and Runciman in the south. It is not contiguous; the section from Waiwera to Whangaparaoa Peninsula is separate from its nearest neighbouring suburb of Long Bay. Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east, the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemata Harbour on the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the few cities in the world to have two harbours on two separate major bodies of water."

S"Sousse or Sousa (Arabic: \xd8\xb3\xd9\x88\xd8\xb3\xd8\xa9 S\xc5\xabsa\xe2\x80\x8e, Berber: Susa) is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 kilometres (87 miles) south of the capital Tunis, the city has 173,047 inhabitants (2004). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. The name may be of Berber origin: similar names are found in Libya and in the south of Morocco (Bil\xc4\x81d al-S\xc5\xabs). Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles and tourism. It is home to the Universit\xc3\xa9 de Sousse.The city allied itself with Rome during the Punic Wars, thereby escaping damage or ruin and entered a relatively peaceful 700-year period under the Pax Romana. Livy wrote that Hadrumetum was the landing place of the Roman army under Scipio Africanus in the second Punic War. Roman usurper Clodius Albinus was born in Hadrumetum.As part of Bonifacius's revolt against Constantinople, the Vandals were invited in and they took Hadrumetum in 434 AD and renamed the town Hunerikopolis. During the Vandalic War Justinian retook the town in 534 and restored its Roman name.In the 7th century AD Arab-Islamic armies conquered what is now Tunisia and rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. The Arabs seized the city, which in the aftermath of Rome's fall was but a remnant of its former self.[1] They renamed the city S\xc3\xbbsa and within a few decades elevated it to the status of the main seaport of the Aghlabid Dynasty. When the Aghlabids invaded Sicily in 827, S\xc3\xbbsa was their main staging ground."

It is the country's political, cultural and commercial centre and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Amman's population has been estimated around 4,142,629 as of 2014[update],[2] with an additional million residing in the surrounding areas. Other population estimates consider the number of expatriates residing within the city limits and rank the total population much higher.The recent economic growth experienced in Amman is unmatched by any other Arab city except those located in the Persian Gulf area. Amman is also the administrative seat of the homonymous governorate. Amman is also ranked a Beta\xe2\x88\x92 global city on the World city index, the same category as Abu Dhabi, Kuwait City and Manama.Amman was named one of the MENA's best cities according to economic, labour, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. Amman is among the most popular locations for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Furthermore, it is expected that in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region.[6] It is a major tourist destination in the region and the capital is especially popular among Persian Gulf tourists.[7]"

The 2011 census recorded 603,502 people in the city, making it the eighth largest Canadian municipality.[1] The Greater Vancouver area of around 2.4 million inhabitants is the third most populous metropolitan area in the country[1] and the most populous in Western Canada. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada; 52% of its residents have a first language other than English.[3][4] Vancouver is classed as a Beta global city. The City of Vancouver encompasses a land area of about 114 square kilometres, giving it a population density of about 5,249 people per square kilometre (13,590 per square mile). Vancouver is the most densely populated Canadian municipality, and the fourth most densely populated city over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, San Francisco,[5] and Mexico City.The original settlement, named Gastown, grew up on clearcuts on the west edge of the Hastings Mill logging sawmill\'s property, where a makeshift tavern had been set up on a plank between two stumps and the proprietor, Gassy Jack, persuaded the curious millworkers to build him a tavern, on July 1, 1867. From that first enterprise, other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west. Gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed Granville, B.I. ("B.I" standing for "Burrard Inlet"). As part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the CPR, it was renamed "Vancouver" and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city, in 1886. By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and Europe.[6][7] As of 2009, Port Metro Vancouver is the busiest and largest port in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America.[8] While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry.[9] Major film production studios in Vancouver and Burnaby have turned Metro Vancouver into one of the largest film production centres in North America,[10][11] earning it the film industry nickname, Hollywood North.[12][13][14]'

The city proper had a population of 921,000 in 2013.[4]Abu Dhabi houses federal government offices, is the seat of the United Arab Emirates Government, home to the Abu Dhabi Emiri Family and the President of the UAE, who is from this family. Abu Dhabi has grown to be a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed Abu Dhabi to a larger and advanced metropolis. Today the city is the country's center of political and industrial activities, and a major cultural and commercial centre, due to its position as the capital. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $400 billion United Arab Emirates economy.[5]Abu Dhabi is home to important financial institutions such as the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the corporate headquarters of many companies and numerous multinational corporations.

It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of public transport, including the Kiev Metro.The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders (see Name, below). During its history, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial centre as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars,[8] until seized by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus', the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours; first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, followed by Poland and Russia.[9]"

It is also one of the municipalities of Qatar.Doha also serves as the seat of government of Qatar. Doha is home to the Education City, an area devoted to research and education. Doha was the site of the first ministerial-level meeting of the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization negotiations. The city of Doha held the 2006 Asian Games, the largest of the series held to that time.[citation needed] Doha also hosted the 2011 Pan Arab Games and most of the games at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. Doha hosted the UNFCCC Climate Negotiations (COP 18) December 2012 and will host a large number of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The World Petroleum Council held the 20th World Petroleum Conference in Doha in December 2011.[3]In 1825, the city of Doha was founded under the name Al-Bidda. The name "Doha" came from the Arabic Ad-Daw\xe1\xb8\xa5a, "the big tree." The reference might be to a prominent tree that stood at the site where the original fishing village arose, on the eastern coast of the Qatar peninsula. Or it might have been derived from "dohat" \xe2\x80\x94 Arabic for bay or gulf \xe2\x80\x94 referring to the Doha Bay area surrounding the Corniche. In 1825, during the war between Qatar and Bahrain, Doha had been severely damaged and Abu Dhabi was helping Bahrain.[4] In 1882, Al Rayyan built the Al Wajbah fortress, in southwestern Doha. The following year, Sheikh Qassim bin Mohammed Al Thani led a Qatari army to victory against the Ottoman Empire.'

The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, ranked as the second most populous metropolitan area in Brazil, the sixth most populous in the Americas and the eighteenth largest in the world. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\'s third most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named "Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea", identified by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 in the category Cultural Landscape.[4]Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a captaincy of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a State of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King Jo\xc3\xa3o VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960.'

S'Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as Washington, "the District", or simply D.C., is the capital of the United States. The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country\'s East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress and the District is therefore not a part of any U.S. state.The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the preexisting settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. Named in honor of George Washington, the City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia and created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District in 1871.Washington, D.C., had an estimated population of 646,449 in 2013, the 23rd most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city\'s population to more than one\xc2\xa0million during the workweek. The Washington metropolitan area, of which the District is a part, has a population of 5.8\xc2\xa0million, the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country.'

It is also the capital of Riyadh Province, and belongs to the historical regions of Najd and Al-Yamama. It is situated in the center of the Arabian Peninsula on a large plateau, and is home to 5.7 million people, and the urban center of a region with a population of close to 7.3\xc2\xa0million people.The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, managed by Riyadh Municipality headed by the mayor of Riyadh, and the Riyadh Development Authority, chaired by the governor of Riyadh Province, Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud. The current mayor of Riyadh is Abdullah bin Abdulrahman Almogbel, appointed in 2012. Riyadh has the largest all female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University.[2] It has been designated as a Beta World City.During the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site was called Hajr (Arabic: \xd8\xad\xd8\xac\xd8\xb1\xe2\x80\x8e), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa.[3] Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveller Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as "the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj.'

It lies one third of the way down the South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula, which itself, since 2006, lies within the formal limits of Christchurch. The population of Christchurch City at the 5 March 2013 census was 341,469.[2]The city was named by the Canterbury Association, which settled the surrounding province of Canterbury. The name of Christchurch was agreed on at the first meeting of the association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by John Robert Godley, who had attended Christ Church, Oxford. Some early writers called the town Christ Church, but it was recorded as Christchurch in the minutes of the management committee of the association.[3] Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand.The river that flows through the centre of the city (its banks now largely forming an urban park) was named Avon at the request of the pioneering Deans brothers to commemorate the Scottish Avon, which rises in the Ayrshire hills near what was their grandfathers' farm and flows into the Clyde.[3]"

Situated in the north-east of the country in the heart of historic Mashonaland, the city has an estimated population of 1,606,000 (2009),[5] with 2,800,000 in its metropolitan area (2006). Administratively, Harare is a metropolitan province, which also incorporates Chitungwiza town and Epworth.[6] It is situated at an elevation of 1,483 metres (4,865\xc2\xa0feet) and its climate falls into the subtropical highland category.The city was founded in 1890 by the Pioneer Column, a small military force in the service of the British South Africa Company, and named Fort Salisbury after the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. Company administrators demarcated the city and ran it until Southern Rhodesia achieved responsible government in 1923. Salisbury was thereafter the seat of the Southern Rhodesian (later Rhodesian) government and, between 1953 and 1963, the capital of the Central African Federation. It retained the name Salisbury until 1982, when it was renamed Harare on the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence.Harare is Zimbabwe's leading financial, commercial, and communications centre, and a trade centre for tobacco, maize, cotton, and citrus fruits. Manufactured goods include textiles, steel and chemicals, and gold is mined in the area. The city's suburbs include Borrowdale, Mount Pleasant and Avondale; the most affluent neighbourhoods are to the north.

Located on the east bank of the Hooghly river, it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, while the Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port as well as its sole major riverine port. As of 2011, the city had 4.5\xc2\xa0million residents; the urban agglomeration, which comprises the city and its suburbs, was home to approximately 14.1\xc2\xa0million, making it the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. As of 2008, its economic output as measured by gross domestic product ranked third among South Asian cities, behind Mumbai and Delhi.[6] As a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, Kolkata confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems.In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Kolkata were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading license in 1690,[7] the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified mercantile base. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Kolkata in 1756 after company started evading taxes and due to increasing militarization of the fort, the East India Company retook it in the following year and in 1793 assumed full sovereignty after Mughal governorship (Nizamat) was abolished. Under East India Company and later under the British Raj, Kolkata served as the capital of India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi. The city was the centre of the Indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata\xe2\x80\x94which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics\xe2\x80\x94witnessed several decades of relative economic stagnation.
